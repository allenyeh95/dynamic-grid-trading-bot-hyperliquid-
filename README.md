Dynamic Grid Trading(DGT) Bot (Hyperliquid)
A robust dynamic grid trading bot specifically engineered for the Hyperliquid exchange. This bot is designed for high availability and sophisticated risk management.

🚀 Deployment & Execution
The bot is optimized for seamless operation across different environments:

PythonAnywhere: Ideal for stable, 24/7 cloud hosting with minimal setup.

PowerShell: Fully compatible with Windows environments for local monitoring and rapid development.

🛡️ Two-Stage Defense Mechanism
To navigate high-volatility markets, the bot implements a rigorous dual-layer security protocol:

Layer 1: Liquidation Safeguard (LIQUIDATION_PCT)
The bot continuously monitors the gap between the mark price and your liquidation price. By setting a specific LIQUIDATION_PCT threshold, the system triggers protective measures (such as cancelling orders or reducing exposure) before a liquidation event can occur.

Layer 2: Adaptive Position Adjustment
The bot features an intelligent feedback loop that scales based on your Position Size. As your exposure increases, the bot automatically adjusts grid density and order sizing. This dynamic re-calibration ensures that the bot de-risks during heavy drawdowns and optimizes capital efficiency when the position is lean.
